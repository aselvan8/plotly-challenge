## Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Using Plotly

1. Used D3 library to read in `samples.json`
2. Created initial function to display subject ID number for dropdown menu and displayed infomation of first subjects information and charts.  
3. Created interactive Webpage, when select new subject ID, with change in event in html through dropdown triggers to look for demographic info and to plot top 10 OTUs for the subject ID as well displayed distribution of OTU's through bubble chart.
